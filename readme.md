# TFBCommon #

## What is it? ##

TFBCommon is a really simple plugin for bukkit that enables access to essential commands, along with a few extras that sometimes come in handy.

The plugin itself is nothing special, but you are welcome to fork it and mess around with the source (Which is, of course, why it is on Github!)
